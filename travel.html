    <br>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big" style="color: rgb(12, 12, 12); font-size: 20PX;">The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila in Hindi, is a historic fort located in the heart of Old Delhi, India. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the 17th century as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Construction began in 1638 and was completed in 1648.

            The Red Fort is renowned for its imposing red sandstone walls, which give it its distinctive appearance. The fort's architecture is a blend of Mughal, Persian, Timurid, and Indian styles, reflecting the cultural diversity of the Mughal Empire. The complex covers a vast area and includes palaces, pavilions, gardens, and other structures.
            
            One of the most famous features of the Red Fort is the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), where the emperor would meet his subjects and listen to their grievances. The Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience) is another notable structure, adorned with intricate marble inlay work and once used for private meetings and receptions.

        <p>SOME BASIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GATEWAY OF INDIA</p>
        <BR>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The Gateway of India is an iconic monument located in Mumbai, India. It was built during the British Raj era to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder (now the location of the Gateway) in 1911. Designed by architect George Wittet, construction began in 1915 and was completed in 1924.

            The monument stands as a fusion of Hindu and Muslim architectural styles, with elements of Indo-Saracenic and Mughal architecture. Its prominent features include a large arch, intricate lattice work, and domes. The Gateway of India overlooks the Arabian Sea and has become one of Mumbai's most famous landmarks, attracting tourists from around the world.
            
            In addition to its historical significance, the Gateway of India holds cultural importance as well. It has been the site of various events and ceremonies, including the departure of the last British troops from India in 1948 and the arrival of numerous foreign dignitaries. Today, it serves as a popular tourist destination and a symbol of Mumbai's rich history and architectural heritage. </p></div>
